# 🚀 Corporate Task Management System (Intranet App)

This project is a modern task tracking and management system designed for corporate intranet environments. Built with **ASP.NET Core MVC**, it moves beyond traditional list views by implementing a **Kanban Board** methodology and a robust **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** architecture.

## 🌍 Live Demo

🚀 **Check out the live application here:** 👉 [**https://ik-takip-sistemi.onrender.com/**](https://ik-takip-sistemi.onrender.com/)

*(Note: Since the application is hosted on **Render.com's free tier**, the server spins down after periods of inactivity. The first request might take **20-30 seconds** to wake up. Please be patient!)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Infrastructure

This project leverages modern cloud technologies for deployment and data management:

* **Framework:** .NET 8 (ASP.NET Core MVC)
* **Language:** C#
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (**Neon.tech Serverless**) ☁️
* **Hosting/Deployment:** **Render.com** (CI/CD Pipeline) 🚀
* **ORM:** Entity Framework Core (Code-First Approach)
* **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3, Razor Views
* **Authentication:** ASP.NET Core Identity (Customized)

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Relational Database Architecture 🏗️
Unlike simple CRUD apps, this project ensures data integrity through proper normalization and Foreign Key relationships.
* **One-to-Many Relationships:** Tasks are linked to users via `Guid` (Foreign Keys), ensuring that user profile updates (e.g., name changes) are instantly reflected across all historical tasks.
* **Data Integrity:** Prevents data redundancy and orphan records.

### 2. Dynamic Kanban Board 📋
A visual project management tool that categorizes tasks into three dynamic states:
* **To Do**
* **In Progress**
* **Done**

Users can visualize workflow and bottlenecks at a glance rather than reading static tables.

### 3. Customized Identity System 👤
The standard `IdentityUser` class has been extended to `ApplicationUser` to support custom profile fields (e.g., `FullName`), providing a more personalized user experience instead of relying solely on email addresses.

### 4. Real-Time Dashboard 📊
The home page features a live dashboard that aggregates data using LINQ queries:
* **Personal Workload:** Shows the count of active tasks assigned specifically to the logged-in user.
* **Global Stats:** Displays total tasks, pending work, and completed projects.
